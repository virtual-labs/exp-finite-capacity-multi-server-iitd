      "question": "In an M/M/3/N queueing system, what does the 3 represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "the average number of customers arriving per unit time",
        "b": "the number of servers available",
        "c": "the maximum number of customers allowed in the system",
        "d": "the service rate of the servers"

      },
      "explanations": {
         "b": "According to Kendal notation 3 denotes the number of servers available " 
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "What is the main assumption of the M/M/c/N model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The arrival rate is constant",
        "b": "The service time is constant",
        "c": "The number of servers is constant",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "All of the above. The M/M/c/N model assumes that the arrival rate, service time, and number of servers are all constant"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",

    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a measure of system performance in the M/M/c/N model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Utilization",
        "b": "Waiting time",
        "c": "Arrival rate",
        "d": "Queue length"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Arrival rate. While the arrival rate is an important input parameter in the M/M/c/N model, it is not considered a measure of system performance"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does increasing the number of servers (c) affect system performance in the M/M/c/N model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases utilization and waiting time",
        "b": "Increases utilization and waiting time",
        "c": "Increases utilization but decreases waiting time",
        "d": "Decreases utilization but increases waiting time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Decreases utilization and waiting time. Increasing the number of servers (C) in the M/M/c/N model will decrese the waiting time as well as utilization"
      },
